Caveat is a handwriting type family designed by Pablo Impallari. It is designed for both short annotations and body text usage. For a different style, there is also a sister family, [Caveat Brush](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Caveat+Brush)

The fonts have OpenType features that enable the letters to have slight variations according to their occurrence within a word, for a natural handwritten feel.

The Caveat project was commissioned by Google from Impallari Type, a type design foundry in Rosario, Argentina. To contribute, see [github.com/googlefonts/caveat](https://github.com/googlefonts/caveat)

Updated June 2019 to v1.500: Adding extended Cyrillic, by [Cyreal](http://www.cyreal.org), a type design foundry in Moscow, Russia.
